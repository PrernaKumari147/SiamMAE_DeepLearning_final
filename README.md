# Final Project of Deep Learning - Advanced Course

In this project, we aim to reproduce the Siamese Masked AutoEncoder (SiamMAE) proposed in [Siamese Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14344) using the PyTorch framework.
The dataset we will be pretraining our model will be UCF-101 [UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions
Classes From Videos in The Wild](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/papers/UCF101_CRCV-TR-12-01.pdf). The representation learned by the model will be evaluated on an object segmentation task on DAVIS-2017 [The 2017 DAVIS Challenge on Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00675).

This project was part of the course [DD2412 Deep Learning, Advanced Course](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2412?l=en) at KTH.

Please refer to the notebook example to see how to run the experiments. We could not upload our trained model to the Github due to storage limiations.

## Results
Example of results from object segmentation. The first video was an easy example whereas the second was a harder one. For more details, refer to our project report.
